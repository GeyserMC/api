# Geyser Base API

This repository contains the base api of the Geyser project. This goal of it is to ensure a common api that is provided by both Geyser
and Floodgate, so users can utilize it regardless of Geyser being installed on the server or not.

Currently, only Geyser provides these API features in the Geyser API.

## API versioning 
See [here](/geyser-versioning.md) for more information on the Geyser API version strategy.
